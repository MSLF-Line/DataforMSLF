# DataforMSLF
This repository is for double-blind peer review of research paper "MSLF: Multi-scale legibility function to estimate the legible scale of individual line features"

### Data

1. **Road network with varying levels of legibility.** 

   This data was downloaded from the website of National Mapping Agency (NMA) of China.

2. **Individual lines.**

    Individual lines were used to introduce DoL and MSLF in the paper. 

   1. Shapefile of Individual Lines.
   2. Multiscale Map Images of Individual Lines

3. **OSM Data with legible scale (HAMR)**

   This is the experimental results data which contains the legible scale calculated by MSLF.
